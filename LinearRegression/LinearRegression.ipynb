This section covers the key mathematical components.\n","\n","### The Linear Regression Equation\n","\n","The fundamental equation for simple linear regression is:\n","\n","$$\n","y = mx + b\n","$$\n","\n","For multiple linear regression:\n","\n","$$\n","y = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_2 + ... + \\theta_n x_n\n","$$\n","\n","where:\n","- $y$ is the predicted output.\n","-

Function (Mean Squared Error - MSE)\n","\n","To measure how well our model fits the data, we use the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:\n","\n","$$\n","MSE = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n","$$\n","\n","where:\n","- m is the number of training examples.\n","- $y_i$ is the actual value of the $i$th sample.\n","- $\\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value of the $i$th sample.\n","\n","The goal is to minimize this cost function to improve model accuracy.\n","\n","### Optimization using Gradient Descent\n","\n","Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function by updating model parameters iteratively:\n","\n","$$\n","\\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial J(\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta_j}\n","$$\n","\n","where:\n","- α is the learning rate (step size in parameter updates).\n","- J(θ) is the cost function.\n","\n","Gradient Descent ensures that we converge towards the optimal values of `$θ$`.\n","\n","### Analytical Solution: Normal Equation\n","\n","Instead of using Gradient Descent, we can directly compute the optimal parameters using the **Normal Equation**:\n","\n","$$\n","\\theta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y\n","$$\n","\n","where:\n","- X is the matrix of input features.\n","- y is the output vector.\n","\n","This method is computationally efficient for small datasets but may be slow for large datasets
